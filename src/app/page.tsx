            From a young age, I enjoyed building custom game levels‚Äîan early sign of my passion for creating and
            coding. Today, I channel that same creativity and logic into developing clean, user-focused applications
            and solving real-world problems using my new and strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and
            full-stack development.
